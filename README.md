## 📖 About This Repository

My Machine Learning portfolio, showcasing various models and techniques on diverse datasets. Each folder is a standalone project with its own code, data, and detailed README.

---

## 🚀 Projects Included

Here is a list of the projects currently in this repository:

1.  **[Movie Recommender System](./1_Movie%20Recommender/)**
    * A project focused on building a recommendation engine to suggest movies to users, likely using techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

2.  **[Email Spam Classifier](./2_Email%20Spam%20Classifier/)**
    * A classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) project to classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). This project likely involves text preprocessing and a classification model like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression.

## 💻 Technologies Used

This repository primarily uses **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**. Key libraries used across these projects may include:

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** For building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **NLTK / spaCy:** For natural language processing tasks.

## 📦 Getting Started

To run these projects on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
    cd your-repo-name
```

2.  **Navigate to a project directory:**
```bash
    cd Machine-Learning-Projects/1_Movie Recommender
```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment first.
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook :**
    If you want to train the model yourself, run the `code.ipynb` notebook

5.  **Run the application:**
```bash
    streamlit run file_name.py
```
